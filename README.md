## Development server

```
#Run for a dev server.
$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

```
#Generate Component with route and module
$ ng g c <component-name> --route app.route --module app.module

#Generate Service
$ ng g s <service-name>

#Generate component
$ ng g c <component-name>

```

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
